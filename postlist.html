    <h2>List of Posts</h2>
    This page contains a list of posts written by me, Peter, that, hopefully, tell of interesting aspects of working at the forest. They are arranged in the order of newest to oldest.
    <ul>
        {% for post in collections.post reversed -%}
        <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.date | dateFormat }}: {{ post.data.title }}</a></li>
        {% endfor -%}
    </ul>
