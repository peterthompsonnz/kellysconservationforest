## East Bush Lookout

The lookout point has a simple bench where people can sit and recuperate from the steepish climb up to it. There is also an impressive looking [Australian Gum tree](https://www.abc.net.au/gardening/factsheets/gum-trees/9431664) that acts as a backdrop.

View from the lookout towards Stoke and the Waimea Estuary. Rabbit Island can be seen in the middle right of the picture.
