## Collecting plants from Titoki Nurseries

Today Lindy, Christie and I (Peter) collected over 4000 plants from Titoki Nurseries near Brightwater. A planting day is planned for this Saturday. Tasman Environment Trust and "The Honda People" are involved in the planting. Apparently some members of the public will be involved too. Below are some pictures that I took of the trip to the nursery.

We used three vehicles for the task and two trailers: Lindy's car towing a trailer, the small white truck, the white Ford ute towing a horsefloat. It was quite a convey.

Above are some of the block of plants that were put aside for Lindy at the nursery. Some have already been loaded onto the vehicles.

Below is a picture of the small truck loaded to the gills. There are even some boxes of plants on the passenger seats.

The white ute loaded up. The back and passenger seats were loaded as well.

Boxes of plants arranged around the cattle trough at the top of the farm. They are put there so they can be easily watered. Note the bunches of willow sticks laying part-way in the trough. Jenkins Hill can be seen in the background.
