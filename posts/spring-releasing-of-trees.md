## Releasing of Trees - Spring 2021

A [prior post](../releasing-trees/) talked about the releasing of trees during summer. Releasing can also be done during spring once the grass has reached the seed head formation stage. At this point it will not grow much more and will start to fall over under its own weight. This is the ideal time to 'stamp' it down around the tree. Stamping basically involves walking around the tree on top of the grass. It is important to make sure the grass stems are bent horizontal at their base. In addition the fallen grass will 'mulch' the tree by shading the ground, thereby helping to keep moisture in it.

The [foxglove](https://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora/species/digitalis-purpurea/) is a pretty plant but takes nutrients from the tree. They are easy to pull out or cut back.

Another releasing method is to cut the grass at the base with a [sickle](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sickle). This is more time consuming and the grass is likely to regrow. However, it can be useful in summer and in areas that have been closely planted. In such areas grass flattened around one tree can overlay a neighbouring one.

The trees are difficult to see amongst the long grass.

They are easier to see once the long grass has been stamped down. The actual flattening is greater than what can be seen in this picture due to the height and angle of the camera.

This young [rimu](https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/native-tree-factsheets/rimu-info-sheet.pdf) is doing very well.
