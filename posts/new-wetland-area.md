## Aerial map of the forest with new wetland area and older part of forest outlined

Below is an aerial view of the forest with the old forest and planted areas outlined in yellow and the new wetland area extension outlined in red. The wetland has already been planted with a few plants and this Winter intensive planting will happen. About 5,000 native plants will be planted starting from mid-may. There has not been any substantial rain for quite a while, and significant downfalls will have to occur before planting begins. 

If you look closely at the wetland area, greener shades in the small gullies can be seen, and this is where the wet areas are mainly.
