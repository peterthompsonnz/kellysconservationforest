## Country Road

Though close the city, the conservation forest is situated off of a typical looking New Zealand country road.

Looking up the Enner Glynn road towards the hills. The Jenkins Creek stream can be seen on the right and [Jenkins Hill](https://nelsontrails.co.nz/jenkins-hill/) can be seen in the distance.

Looking down the road. A blue, blue sky with pretty clouds. A great Spring day.
