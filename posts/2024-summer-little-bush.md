## Summer in the Little Bush

Today I did some weed control work in the Little Bush. The trees are doing well, as can be seen from the pictures further down this page. Also, I came across the biggest spider that I have ever seen. What a beauty.

Here are a few pictures that I took of the trees. I am really happy with their progress as in the past I have put alot of time into weed control.
