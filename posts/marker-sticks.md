## Marker Sticks

The new wetland area is due to be planted with about 5000 trees and plants this winter. Ideally, beside each one a marker stick will driven in. These will mark their position so when grass grows up around them in the spring they will be easy to find. This is helpful when releasing or strimming is done in the summer to clear the grass away. 

The sticks are gathered from local timber merchants who have little use for them. The sticks official name is 'fillets sticks' and they are used to separate the layers of wood that are delivered in bundles to the merchants. Below are: 1) pictures of the sticks on the back of the truck before they are unloaded; 2) sticks piled up in the shed waiting to be painted; 3) A pile of painted sticks. Note that only the tops of the sticks need to be painted.
