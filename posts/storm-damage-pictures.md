## Pictures of Storm Damage

The forest has suffered major damage with multiple slips and loss of vegitation due to a series of tropical rain storms. Sadly, many years of hard work have been undone. This page contains pictures of slips and other damage in the West Block. Note the build-up of 'sludgie' silt at the base of slips and washouts.

Looking up the access road. It is blocked by trees and soft silt that has come down in a slip from the slope above the road (on the right).

View from the picnic area. The stream in the centre of the picture is new. Before the storm there were trees in this area. Marker sticks can be seen in the remaining grassy areas. The water has come from the forested gully at the top of the picture. Normally it ran down a track which can't be seen.

View looking downstream of the stream by the picnic area. The Enner Glynn road can just be seen in the distance. The road has suffered major damage due to Jenkins Creek breeching its banks.

A surviving bridge over the creek that runs through the main forest gully. This is a testiment to how well it was built. The bank has been eaten away near the far end of the bridge.
