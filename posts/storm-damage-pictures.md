## Pictures of Storm Damage

Pictures of slips and other storm damage. Note the build-up of silt in the creek and the loss of trees.

Looking up the access road. It is blocked by trees and soft silt that has come down in a slip from the slope above the road (on the right).

View from the picnic area. The stream in the centre of the picture is new. Before the storm there were trees in this area. Marker sticks can be seen in the remaining grassy areas. The water has come from the forested gully at the top of the picture. Normally it ran down a track which can't ne seen.
