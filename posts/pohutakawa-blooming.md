## Pohutukawa in Bloom

Below are pictures of a Pohutukawa tree, growing by one of the tracks, in full bloom (note that the wooden cross does not indicate a grave - it is the name of the tree). Pohutukawa trees are not common in the South Island, instead Southern Ratas are more prevalent. In looks the two trees are similar. The main difference is their climatic ranges and preferences.
