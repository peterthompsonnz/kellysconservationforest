## Track repairs after recent heavy rain

Recent heavy rain caused the creek that runs through the old bush, the new plantings and on into Jenkins stream, to flood, eat into its banks and spread its course. The picture below graphically shows this.

The quick fix is to cut into the bank on the right of the grassy track to winden the track. Another option would be to reroute the track higher up the slope, but this would entail much more work. This may need to be done in the future though.

The following two pictures show: 1) Ian and Lindy working on the track; 2)the finished job.
