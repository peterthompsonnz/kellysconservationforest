## Slip damage working bee on a lovely spring day

There have been two major slips in the East Block. Below are some pictures of work that we did on the minor one.

The slip area as seen from above. Note how the slip has crossed the path (seen on the left) and continued on down the hill. A rough track has been made through the slip debri.

Hole being dug in the field above the slip in which to put a poplar sapling. The hole is quite deep because the poplar sapling is quite thick and tall. Hopefully when the polar grows it will prevent further slipping of this area.
