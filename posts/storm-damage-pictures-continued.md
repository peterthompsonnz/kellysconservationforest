## More Pictures of Storm Damage

There are more pictures to do with the storm damage on this page.

<img width="900" height="506" src="/assets/images/news/storm-damage-pictures-continued/west-bush1.jpg" alt="view of slips on the west bush">

The picture above shows how extensive the slip damage is on the slopes of the West Bush.

<img width="900" height="506" src="/assets/images/news/storm-damage-pictures-continued/west-bush2.jpg" alt="another view of slips on the west bush, looking more towards the old bush" loading="lazy">

Another (rather washed out) view of slips on the West Bush. This time looking more towards the old bush, which is on the right. Note the slip damage in that area.

<img width="900" height="506" src="/assets/images/news/storm-damage-pictures-continued/a-slump.jpg" alt="This patch has 'slumped' or collapsed down the slope" loading="lazy">

This patch has become saturated and consequently 'slumped' or broken away from the slope until it has reached a walking track which has halted its progress. Bare clay can be seem where the movement started.

<img width="900" height="644" src="/assets/images/news/storm-damage-pictures-continued/gorse-root.jpg" alt="gorse has a main tap root that is very long" loading="lazy">

Because the slumped earth is so wet it is easy to pull smaller <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/colleges/college-of-sciences/clinics-and-services/weeds-database/gorse.cfm">Gorse</a> bushes out. Normally, because of its long tap-root, this is hard to do. The root in the above picture has been overlayed in red so it can better be seen. The open wet structure of the soil can also be seen.

<img width="600" height="550" src="/assets/images/news/storm-damage-pictures-continued/digger-at-work.jpg" alt="a digger and truck clearing the access road" loading="lazy">

The picture above shows a digger and truck (behind the digger) at work clearing the access road. As well as taking the spoil away, the truck brings in hard fill.

<img width="450" height="800" src="/assets/images/news/storm-damage-pictures-continued/access-road-surface.jpg" alt="the road has been repaired with aggregate" loading="lazy">

The road has been repaired with large sized stone aggregate.
