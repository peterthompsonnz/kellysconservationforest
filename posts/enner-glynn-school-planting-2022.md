## Enner Glynn school's planting day in the wetland area - July 2022

The weather was fine and the children got stuck into the planting. Afterwards they slid down a nearby grassy slope using tobogans and plastic sheets. Below are some photos of the event.

It was a long trek from school along Enner Glynn road and then up the hill to the wetland planting area. The children were ready for their morning tea/lunch before they started planting.

The children gathered around Lindy as she demonstrated the right way to plant a tree.

The grass had been sprayed with weedkiller to make it easier to dig holes in which to plant.

Children had the option of working in pairs. Two things to note: 1) for privacy reasons the closest little girl's features have been pixelated; 2) the children wrote their names on the sticks with which they marked the position of the plants. The sticks are necessary as in time the grass will grow up and hide the plants.
