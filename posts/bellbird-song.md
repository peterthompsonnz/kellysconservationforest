Tuis and Bellbirds are the most prevalent native birds in the forest. Below is a 33 second recording of a [Bellbird, or Korimako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird) song made in the Little Bush recently. The buzzing of a fly is also present in a few places. Note that you may need to adjust the volume up on your device.
