## 2023 Winter Planting

This winter planting occured in a new area of the farm. The land faced the sun, sloped and faced North to North-West. In the picture below the suburb of Bishopdale can be seen and in the distance the sea. Also, from the above picture severe erosion caused by the rainstorms of last Winter (Winter of 2022).

The weather was good, as is often the case in a Nelson Winter, and the planting was pleasant and quite manageable.

A healthy Pittosporum plant is pictured below. The stick is to show the plant's position when the grass grows up in the Spring.
