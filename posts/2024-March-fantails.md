## Pictures of fantails

### There are alot around at the moment

There are alot of cheeky fantails around at the moment. There were six flitting around me when I was working in the bush a day ago. One had black colouring, which is unusual, but not unheard of. I was able to catch some on the wing, as can be seen in these photos.

Note that the fantail is flying upsidedown in the above photo. They are very athletic little birds and can fly in tight spaces due to their large and dynamic tail that they can rotate and spread out to varying degrees, depending on the manoeuvre they are doing. They "flit about" rather than fly in straight lines.
