[Pittosporum](https://www.bunnings.com.au/diy-advice/garden/planting-and-growing/planting-growing-and-pruning-pittosporums) are a commonly planted native in New Zealand gardens because they are attractive, grow quickly and are relatively cheap. They do well in the Forest. Because they grow quickly they can get above the Spring grass growth. In the background can be seen the slopes of the West block.
