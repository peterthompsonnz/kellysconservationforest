## Spring Growth in the East Block

Spring has well and truely sprung. It is a lovely time of year with plants in full, lush green growth.

Pasture with Poplar trees planted to stabilise the land. [Jenkins Hill](https://nelsontrails.co.nz/jenkins-hill/) can be seen in the background.

[Pittosporum](https://www.bunnings.com.au/diy-advice/garden/planting-and-growing/planting-growing-and-pruning-pittosporums) are a commonly planted native in New Zealand gardens because they are attractive, grow quickly and are relatively cheap. They do well in the Forest. Because they grow quickly they can get above the Spring grass growth. In the background can be seen the slopes of the West block.

[Pseudopanax](https://www.aucklandbotanicgardens.co.nz/plants-for-auckland/plants/pseudopanax-lessonii/) are another commonly planted native in New Zealand gardens.

A juvenile [Lancewood](https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-plants/lancewood-horoeka/). Once established this plant easily grows above the grass.
