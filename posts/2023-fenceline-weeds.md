## Clearing weeds from a fenceline

It's summer and the weeds are in full growth. I revisited an area on a bank near the bottom of the bush that I had cleared years ago, and was suprised by how few weeds there were. The pictures below show before and after shots and poison gel on an old man's beard root.

You can just see the broom seed pods by the metal post. Old man's beard leaves can be seen amongst the grass at the bottom of the picture.

Note the posion gel bottle amongst the grass.
