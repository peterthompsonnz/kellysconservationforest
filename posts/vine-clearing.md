## Clearing Vines from Trees

![Picture of passionfruit vines hanging from trees](/images/news/clearing-vines/vines2.jpg)

Above is a picture of vines hanging from trees. The vines are a mixture of two types: banana passionfruit and old man's beard. The vines can smoother a tree's foliage causing its leaves to die. Naturally enough this is not good for the tree. The picture below is a closer view and it shows a tangle of banana pashionfruit vines.

**A before shot**: The vines can be quite thick in size if they have been growing for some time. The picture below shows old man's beard vines growing up from the base of a kanuka tree.

**The after shot**: The vines have been cut back (and poisoned - though this cannot be seen in this picture).

Below is a picture of some of the 'tools of the trade': leather gloves and a bottle of poison. Missing is the pruning saw that is used to cut the vines - they are quite soft.
