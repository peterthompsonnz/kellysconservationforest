    <h2>Releasing Trees</h2>
<p>An important task during summer is the releasing of trees. This entails the cutting back of plant growth (mainly grasses) from over and around young trees. Once trees are three or so years old they are usually big enough to escape overgrowth and so do not need releasing, unless it is from something like brambles, banana passionfruit, or old mans beard.</p>
<p>Below are before and after pictures of a <strong>Pittosporum eugenioides</strong> or <strong>Lemonwood</strong> tree. In the second picture a <strong>Niwashi Traditional Japanese Garden Cutter</strong> tool can be seen. It is ideal for releasing as it is light and has an extremely sharp blade that holds its edge well.</p>
