  replant areas around the original forest, It is now more than four times its original size. They have built
  trails, picnic areas, steps and bridges, and welcome over 1000 visitors every year through open days,
  educational visits and school plantings.">

    <h2>Monitoring Cameras</h2>
<p>Don Selford has placed a number of cameras around the forest. They are used to monitor the prevalance of pests, such as rats, possums and stoats (and the occasional cat), and also the abundance and type of native wild life. The cameras are waterproof, and run on batteries which can last up to 3 months. They are trigured by movement and use an infrared system at night. As well as pests the cameras record bird life such as tuis and bellbirds. Pictures of English garden birds are also captured.</p>
<h2>Camera Setup</h2>

Cameras are set up near feeding stations. These are usually tubs of water that attract all kinds of animals.</p>

The cameras take 8 AA sized batteries. These can last up to 3 months depending on the quality of the batteries and how often they are triggered.</p>
<h2>Pests Captured by Cameras</h2>
<p>Below are examples of the type of pests captured by cameras. These pictures where taken at a popular feeding station.</p>
<p><img src="/images/news/cameras/stoat.jpg" alt="Picture of a stoat"><br />
Stoats are one of the worst pests as they are very destructive towards native wild life.</p>
<p><img src="/images/news/cameras/cat.jpg" alt="Picture of a wild cat"><br />
Wild cats are also efficient killers.</p>
