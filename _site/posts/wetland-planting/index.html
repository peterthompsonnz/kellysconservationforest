      <h2>Wetland Planting - Spring 2021</h2>
<p>The wetland area is located on the slopes above the old remnant bush. It has been used as grazing land for cattle, but is now fenced off and being planted with suitable plants. The main planting is planned to be done next autumn. In the maen time some minor planting is being done before the heat and dryness of summer make such work unviable. Today native flaxes and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_maire">Swamp Maire</a> were planted. This article makes interesting reading: <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/67540865/5-great-plants-for-wet-and-boggy-land">5 great plants for wet and boggy land</a>. Following are three views of the wetland area.</p>

<p>An far away view. The wetland is in the low areas in the picture. It starts at bottom left then curves upwards in the middle of the picture to go between the cattle and the trees. If you look closely white sticks that indicate where a plant is to be planted can be seen.</p>

<p>Vegetation has been sprayed with weed killer around the sticks so the plants, for a start, do not have to compete with quick growing grasses. The sticks indicate where a plant is to be planted and also they make the plant easy to find when grass regrowth happens.</p>
