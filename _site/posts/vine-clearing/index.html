  replant areas around the original forest, It is now more than four times its original size. They have built
  trails, picnic areas, steps and bridges, and welcome over 1000 visitors every year through open days,
  educational visits and school plantings.">

    <h2>Clearing Vines from Trees</h2>
<p><img src="/images/news/clearing-vines/vines2.jpg" alt="Picture of passionfruit vines hanging from trees"></p>
<p>Above is a picture of vines hanging from trees. The vines are a mixture of two types: banana passionfruit and old man's beard. The vines can smoother a tree's foliage causing its leaves to die. Naturally enough this is not good for the tree. The picture below is a closer view and it shows a tangle of banana pashionfruit vines.</p>

<p><strong>A before shot</strong>: The vines can be quite thick in size if they have been growing for some time. The picture below shows old man's beard vines growing up from the base of a kanuka tree.</p>

<p><strong>The after shot</strong>: The vines have been cut back (and poisoned - though this cannot be seen in this picture).</p>

<p>Below is a picture of some of the 'tools of the trade': leather glooves and a bottle of poison. Missing is the pruning saw that is used to cut the vines - they are quite soft.
