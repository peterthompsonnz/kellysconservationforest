  replant areas around the original forest, It is now more than four times its original size. They have built
  trails, picnic areas, steps and bridges, and welcome over 1000 visitors every year through open days,
  educational visits and school plantings.">

    <h2>Street Protest</h2>
<p><img src="/images/news/street-protest/truck-with-protest-signs.jpg" alt="Lindy's old truck decked out with signage"></p>
<p>Today Lindy protested through town with her old truck. Moana and Christy went along as well - plus Lindy's faithful dogs.</p>
<p>Lindy says that this is because the subdivision is still progressing through the Nelson City Council (NCC) and she still hasn't been named as an affected party.</p>
<p>On Tuesday at 9am Lindy and her daughter Amy will present a case to the Environment committee. Several prominent supporters along with up to 50 others will be present. The meeting will be held in the Council chambers, Civic house, NCC.</p>
<p>This will probably be the last chance to have a say because there has been a commissioner appointed to have the final say next week. The forest project lives or dies on this decision!</p>
