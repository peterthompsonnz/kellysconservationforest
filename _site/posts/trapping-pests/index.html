      <h2>Trapping Pests</h2>
<p>There is an extensive network of traps in the forest to deal with pests such as possums, rats, mice and stoats. Below is a picture of a possum caught in a <strong>Trapinator</strong> trap. The possum is attracted to the trap by the smell of a lure, such as peanut butter, and a (powerful) spring loaded bar is triggered when the possum puts its head far enough into the trap. Death is virtually instantaneous as the possum's neck is broken. Click on the following link to find out more about the trap: <a href="https://www.traps.co.nz/trapinator-possum-kill-trap">Trapinator</a></p>

<h2>Goodnature A12 Trap</h2>
<p>Below are two pictures of a <a href="https://goodnature.co.nz/">goodnature</a> <strong>A12</strong> trap that is designed to kill possums. The top picture shows a side on view of the trap. At the right-hand end in the orange section is a gas canister that enables the trap to reset itself after it has sprung or 'fired'. This means that the trap can operate unsupervised for longer than a conventional one that has to be reset each time it is sprung. In the black centre section of the trap is a bolt that fires forward, penetrates the possum's brain, then withdraws, letting the possum's body to fall to the ground. The trap is then ready for its next 'victim'.</p>
<p>The lower picture shows the chamber into which the possum sticks its head as it seeks to get at a food lure. The trap's triggering mechanism, the orange block that the lure is attached to, can be seen. Also the underside of the gas canister is visible on the right of the picture.</p>
<p>Goodnature have discontinued the manufacture of the A12 and are now concentrating on producing the <a href="https://goodnature.co.nz/products/a24-rat-stoat">A24 stoat and rat trap</a></p>
