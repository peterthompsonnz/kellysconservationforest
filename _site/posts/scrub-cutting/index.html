    <h2>Scrub Cutting</h2>
<p><img src="/images/news/scrub-cutting/gorse-along-top-of-bank.jpg" alt="Picture of gorse along top of bank"></p>
<p>Above is a 'before' picture of gorse growing along the top of a bank. It is part of a section of land that is infested with brambles, old man's beard and to a lesser extent banana passionfruit. The best way to tackle these is to use a scrub cutter to cut and &quot;munch up&quot; as much of the scrub as possible. then come back and spray regrowth in a couple of months time. Below is a picture of the scrub cutter (a Stihl) looking along the machine from the cutting head to the motor. The following link points to a page with information on a similar scrub cutter: <a href="https://www.stihlshop.co.nz/default/stihl-fs-85-r-petrol-brushcutter.html">STIHL FS 85 R Petrol Brushcutter</a></p>

<p>The most effective scrub cutting technique is to first break up the top growth by moving the cutting head in an up and down motion. This will help create a mulch of leaves and stems that will break down quite quickly and allow the scrub to quickly regrow (and be ready to be sprayed). The head is then moved horizontally near ground level to severe the stems of the scrub.</p>
