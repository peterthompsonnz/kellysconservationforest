  trails, picnic areas, steps and bridges, and welcome over 1000 visitors every year through open days,
  educational visits and school plantings.">

    <h2>Slip Damage</h2>
<p>Recent heavy rain has caused a slip at the bottom of the western block down by the creek. Today Lindy, Ian and I planted poplar saplings and other plants in an effort to stabilise the slope. Below is a picture of Ian making a path across the bottom of the slip.</p>
<p>The slip is still very wet, as can be seen by the small stream to the left of Ian.</p>

<p>The picture below shows how the slip has gone as far as the creek that ultimately feeds into Jenkins Stream. A tree has been pushed into the creek and is lieing on its side. Since this picture was taken the tree has been cleared.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the picture below, poplar sapplings have been planted to help stabilise the slip. At the top of the picture can be seen the layers that make up the soil profile. Water works its way down through the layers until it hits the hard clay base. It then runs down the top of this layer thus forming a slippery base to the layers above. Being wet and heavy, and on a steep slope, these then slip down.</p>

<p>The last picture shows Ian using a crowbar to make a hole to put a sampling into. These can be seen bundled on the ground behind him.</p>
