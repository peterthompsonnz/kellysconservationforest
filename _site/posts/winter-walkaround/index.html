      <h2>Winter Walkaround</h2>
<p>Today I did a walk around the bush. We have had a wet and mild start to winter and this has suited the trees well.</p>

<p>Above is a picture of a young rimu tree. As can be see it is growing very well. It is somewhat shaded so is protected from the heat during summer. Note the foxglove growing next to it. Unfortunately it is also doing well.</p>
<p>This varigated flax is a real beauty. Note the old flower/seed heads. The tuis love these bushes in the summer.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/13880/kawakawa">kawakawa</a> is taking advantage of the fallen dead branches to spread itself.</p>
