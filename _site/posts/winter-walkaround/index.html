  replant areas around the original forest, It is now more than four times its original size. They have built
  trails, picnic areas, steps and bridges, and welcome over 1000 visitors every year through open days,
  educational visits and school plantings.">

    <h2>Winter Walkaround</h2>
<p>Today I did a walk around the bush. We have had a wet and mild start to winter and this has suited the trees well.</p>

<p>Above is a picture of a young rimu tree. As can be see it is growing very well. It is somewhat shaded so is protected from the heat during summer. Note the foxglove growing next to it. Unfortunately it is also doing well.</p>
<p>This varigated flax is a real beauty. Note the old flower/seed heads. The tuis love these bushes in the summer.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/13880/kawakawa">kawakawa</a> is taking advantage of the fallen dead branches to spread itself.</p>
