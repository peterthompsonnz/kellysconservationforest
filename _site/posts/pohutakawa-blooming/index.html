  replant areas around the original forest, It is now more than four times its original size. They have built
  trails, picnic areas, steps and bridges, and welcome over 1000 visitors every year through open days,
  educational visits and school plantings.">

    <h2>Pohutukawa in Bloom</h2>
<p>Below are pictures of a Pohutukawa tree, growing by one of the tracks, in full bloom (note that the wooden cross does not indicate a grave - it is the name of the tree). Pohutukawa trees are not common in the South Island, instead Southern Ratas are more prevalent. In looks the two trees are similar. The main difference is their climatic ranges and preferences.</p>
