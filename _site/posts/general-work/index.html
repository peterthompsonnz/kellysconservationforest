      <h2>Tree Poisoning</h2>
<p>Below is a picture of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_melanoxylon">Australian Blackwood</a> (Acacia melanoxylon) tree. These are Australian imports that are most unwelcome as they grow and spread quickly. The second picture shows the poisoned stump of the tree once the tree has been cut down. Branches can be seen piled up in the background.</p>

<h2>Slip Progress</h2>
<p>The poplar sapplings planted a few weeks ago on the recent slip have started to sprout. This is an encouraging sign.</p>

<p>Branches from the tree that was pushed into the creek by the slip have been cut off. This means the flow of water in the creek will not be seriously impeded and consequently the walls will not be gouged out.</p>

<p>Lastly, near the bottom of the slip by the creek, is a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagianthus_regius">ribbonwood</a> trees. They are doing very well.</p>
